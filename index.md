## My favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2, part 1
This was a fun lab for me because it was about making a madlib. I liked it because it was a good introduction lab to start things off. I also liked this lab because I was able to understand the code pretty well.

Lab 4, Part 1 
I thought this was a good lab because it was a bit more challenging. It took a bit for me took understand how to code the conversion of the measurements, but once I did, it was kind of fun. Something else I like about the lab is that it made me understand that there are many things that may look simple but are more complex once you know how they are coded.

Lab 7, Part 1
I thought lab & was a good lab because it was challenging, but not too hard. I thought it was hard, but my partner helped me better understand how to do it. I also thought this was a good labe because the process of learning how to code it was fun.
